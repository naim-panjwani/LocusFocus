Known bugs:
- chrX plots do not show correctly
- SS coordinate checking not working - should also check if it's a subregion of full coordinate/locus region

to do:
- remove related individuals prior to calculating LD from the 1000 Genomes
- include option for NFE LD (Non-Finnish European subset) for hg19 1000 Genomes
- standardize the snp names to chr_bp_ref_alt_b37/38 format
- file too large error handler not working
- ensure SS coordinate input is a subregion of the full coordinate input region
- allow uploading of compressed files (then convert to bgzip/tabix)
- need to expand gwas dataset to include snps missing from it, but available in secondary datasets
- allow deleting of the session data
- allow option to match variant names by just chrom:pos information (currently should only be either all rsid's or all variant_id format)
- Generate updated 1KG Phase 3 binary PLINK files for LD calculations (currently only have chr1 2012 1KG file)
- Store json session data into Mongo Atlas instead for better security
- Add a cron job to delete sessions at regular intervals or when disk is almost full
- Allow user to set the window sizes for eQTL lines; make calculation clearer
- Make a table of GWAS and eQTL merged results
- Allow assessment of beta correlations
- Make P-P plot
- Fix coloc2 chromosome X issue
- add requirement for having REF and ALT columns for secondary datasets for better snp matching
